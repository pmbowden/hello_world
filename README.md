Hello?
I'm Parker, and this is my first Git-Hub repository. I'm starting a Python class on Monday, and hope this turns into an enjoyable pastime, and long term turns into a career that will allow me to maximize time with my family and friends. 

You need to stick with this learning process and accomplish this goal. You're life will improve with this skill, and your brain needs a challenge, it's a muscle, work it out!
